### Problem 1 (DF, Problem 7, p. 455)

Let $R=\Z[x,y]$ and let $I=(x,y)$. Define a map

$$
\phi(ax+by,a'x+b'y)=ad-bc\pmod{I}.
$$

Prove that this is a well defined alternating map from $I\times I\to \Z$.

### Problem 2 (DF, Problem 12, p. 455)

Let $F$ be of characteristic $2$ and let $V$ be a vector space over $F$. Prove
that an alternating bilinear map on $F$ is symmetric, but that not every symmetric
bilinear map is alternating.
