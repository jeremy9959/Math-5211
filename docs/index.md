## Abstract Algebra

Math 5211/4211, Spring Semester 2023 <br>
University of Connecticut <br>

###  Instructor

- [Jeremy Teitelbaum](https://jeremy9959.net)

### Introduction

This is the second semester of the year-long graduate-level abstract algebra
course at UConn. The 4211 version of the
course is open to undergraduates but is the same course. 

We will cover core topics in module theory, field theory, and multi-linear algebra.
 

### Schedule

This course meets (in-person) every Tuesday and Thursday from 11:00 a.m. to 12:15 p.m. 
in Monteith 314.

### Textbook

We will rely on *Abstract Algebra, 3rd edition* by Dummit and Foote. 

### Campus Wire

We will take advantage of the  Q&A site [campuswire](https://campuswire.com/c/G8BF642ED/feed)
for online questions and answers.  You should register on the site before class starts.

### Overleaf and TeX

All homework solutions must be submitted in TeX/LaTeX.
The easiest way to work with TeX is via the cloud resource [overleaf.com](http://overleaf.com).
There are many tutorials on that site that provide an introduction to TeX.  In addition, 
[this video](https://youtu.be/C9Icf9Wvp7U) might be helpful.

### Prelim Exam Reference

Information about the algebra prelim, including past exams, is [available here on the department graduate studies website](https://math.uconn.edu/degree-programs/graduate/preliminary-exams/).

### Assessment

Grades in this course will be based on:

- Homework (40%)
- Two exams (30% each)
